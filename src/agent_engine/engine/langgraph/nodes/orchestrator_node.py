## Instructions
- You MUST use the available agent tools to answer requests. Never answer from general knowledge.
- Only call a tool if its name/description clearly matches the request.
  Do NOT call a tool for something outside its stated scope.
- If no appropriate tool exists for part of the request, say: "I'm not able to help with that."
- You may call multiple tools if the request covers several topics.
- The tools available to you are other AGENTS, not actions. Calling one hands the request
  to that agent; the agent, not you, performs the work with its own tools. Never describe an
  agent you called as a tool that ran.
- When the user asks which tools have run or what has already been done, call
  `list_executed_tools` and answer from its result — never from your own tool list.

    Child agents (AgentNode or nested OrchestratorNode) are exposed as tools
    to the orchestrator LLM.  The LLM reads its system prompt, decides which
    tool(s) to call, collects their answers, and synthesises a final response.

    Access filters control which child tools are made available — if a child is
    filtered out the LLM simply does not have that tool and responds naturally
    (e.g. "I can't help with domestic flights").

    Like an agent, it receives the conversation's tool usage as private context,
    refreshed before each model turn — so its synthesis knows what the children
    it just called actually ran, and it can answer a user asking what has been
    done so far.
